# EBAnO-Ecosystem

EBAnO (Explaining BlAck-box mOdels) is a wide research project focused on the explanation of Artificial Intelligence (xAI) models.

## EBAnO Express
EBAnO Express is a simple and reliable explanation tool that can be used to deeply understand the reasons behind every prediction made by DCNN.

The current implementation supports DCNN developed with Keras.

Check out [EBAnO Express](https://github.com/EBAnO-Ecosystem/EBAnO-Express) on the GitHub repo.

## Explanation Library
It is available online a library of explanation produced with EBAnO analyzing four different DCNN models:
- VGG 16
- VGG 19
- Inception V3
- Inception ResNet V2

The explanation library is available at: [EBAnO Explanation Library](http://pasitos.polito.it:9900/library)
